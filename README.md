A guy who likes to take on obscure and difficult projects because I don't want to be a react todo-app script kiddie 🤷🏾.

Languages/techonolgies I use and ❤️:
  - Python (first language i learned + easy to make MVP's)
  - Typescript (type saftey makes js less painful to work with)
  - NextJS (file based routing + love vercel)
  - React (best way to do webdev)
  - Zustand (funny sounding german word)
  - Supabase (superior db)
  - Render (for hosting heavier code)
  - Mojo (currently learning because Python + memory management is crazy)
  - Basically any language needed for the job
