A guy who likes to take on obscure and difficult projects because I don't want to be a React todo-app script kiddie 🤷🏾.

Languages/techonolgies I use and love ❤️:
  - Python (first language i learned + easy to make MVP's)
  - Typescript (js + type safety is the like greatest invention ever)
  - Nextjs (SSR and file based routing are convinient + love vercel)
  - React (best way to do webdev, dont care what the haters say)
  - Supabase (superior db)
  - Render (for hosting heavier code)
  - Mojo (currently learning 🧠 because Python + memory management is the craziest thing I've ever seen)
  - Basically any language needed for the job
